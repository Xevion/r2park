# r2park-bot

A Discord bot for easily registering parking at the Register2Park parking system.

- Select a location for your user account, then register your car with a single command.
- Register against the location using the make, model, and plate.
- Another command can register your email and acquire an email confirmation.

## Feature Ideas

- Register commands in new guilds automatically
- Cache location data for fast autocomplete lookup
- Sub-commands for registering using full details, saved data, or partial saved data.
- Responses are not sent in the same channel, but instead as a hidden message.
- No code stored with a location can be re-tried after registering a code later.
